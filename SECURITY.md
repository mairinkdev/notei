# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability in Notei, please report it responsibly.

## How to report

- **Preferred:** Open a private security advisory on GitHub (Repository → Security → Advisories → New draft).
- **Alternative:** Send details to the maintainers via a private channel (e.g. email if listed in the repo or profile). Do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact if possible. We will respond as we can; we do not guarantee a specific SLA for fixes.

Thank you for helping keep Notei secure.
